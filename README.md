# Percolation
#### This project is to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
#### Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under certain conditions water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface).
#### Implemented Disjoit set to detect if each grid is connected [Union Find](Percolation/UnionFind.java)
#### Percolation engin [Percolation](Percolation/Percolation.java)
